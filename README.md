## Adding semantic HTML elements
We focused on creating more user friendly semantic elements such as:
header
article
section
footer

## Implement a logical structure of styling of both styling and postioning
I accomplished this by placing elements such as 'section' inside of an element such as 'article'

## Placing 'alt' attributes in our image sources
-Created a more user friendly experience by introducing <alt=""> into our images.
