# Horiseon

## Adding Semantic HTML Elements
We focused on creating more user friendly semantic elements such as:
header
article
section
footer

## Implement a Logical Structure of both Styling and Postioning
I accomplished this by placing elements such as 'section' inside of an element such as 'article'

## Placing 'alt' Attributes in our Image Sources
Created a more user friendly experience by introducing alt tags into our images. 

## Fixing Title Element
Changed title element in browser to Horiseon the name of our great company! ❤️️
